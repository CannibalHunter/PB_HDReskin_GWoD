Thank you TG5 (Yummers!#8257/_.druid.), Hardly (harlie#2900/harlieharhar), and ISG (I.S.G.#2720/fourthacronym) 
on the Hideous Destructor Discord Server for maintaining my reskin pack to keep 
up with the weapon mods that have been released while I had pretty much abandoned
it due to my lack of motivation at the time
